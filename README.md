# Elemental
A drag and drop block-based coding environment for front-end web technologies.

Scratch Forums topic: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/134554/

## Project Goal
The goal of Elemental is to act as a bridge between [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and front-end web technology. Any and all design decisions will focus on being easy to pick up, while still retaining all of the major aspects of text-based code, thus creating what might be thought of as "a highly accessible bridge that leads to the perfect ending location".
